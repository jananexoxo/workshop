        <p>Electricity is the best gift of science to mankind. This is the age of electricity. 
            Electricity is a source of light, heat, and other comforts. Right from house lighting 
            to the running of giant factories to streets and parks, it is the invisible current that
             makes these entities run. Electricity supplies all types of energy to man in order to
              improve his scientific inventions and increase his social amenities.  Heating and cooling 
              processes are also executed by it. All you need to do is just switch on a button and 
              there you have ample power.


            Electricity is primarily produced from coal and water. It is also produced from other sources
             like nuclear energy, solar energy, etc. but still, production is very less. Efforts are being
              made to produce more electricity from solar, wind, and nuclear sources so that the natural
               sources can be conserved. </p>
